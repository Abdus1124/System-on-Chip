System on Chip coursework.
FPGA design flow using the Vivado design tool: will formally introduce the FPGA design flow using the Vivado tool where students will step through the complete Xilinx design flow from entry to download. 
Embedded system design on Zynq SoC using the Vivado design tool: will include developing embedded systems on the Xilinx Zynq All Programmable SoC family using the on-chip ARM Cortex-A9 processor system and a set of soft peripherals within the Vivado design environment. 
High-level synthesis flow on Zynq SoC using the Vivado HLS design tool: will provide an understanding of high-level synthesis design methodologies necessary to develop custom peripherals using C/C++ programming languages within the Vivado HLS tool; these peripherals will then be added to a processor system on the Zynq SoC.
